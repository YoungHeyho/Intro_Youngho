                introduce the teamwork I learned through military service, the physical and 
                mental strength I gained through various training, and the knowledge 
                I gained while learning military equipment and techniques. These experiences 
                have had a huge impact on my life, and the lessons and growth 
                I have gained from them have made me a better person.</p>

                <h3>1. Military specialty</h3>
                <p>While serving as a driver, I had the opportunity to drive a variety of military vehicles. 
                    As a towed howitzer driver, I was mainly responsible for vehicles that could be towed, 
                    and in addition to driving, I was able to learn various skills for vehicle 
                    maintenance, management, and safe operation.</p>
                <p>In addition, I served as a PX soldier and chaplain as a second specialty. 
                    I was able to learn responsibility and service spirit through tasks such as 
                    product management, inventory tracking, sales and customer service, 
                    church religious events, and facility management. Additionally, I was able to improve 
                    my interpersonal skills through communicating with a variety of people.</p>

                <h3>2. Training experience</h3>
                <p>Training as a towed howitzer operator was very intense and systematic. 
                    we were mainly trained to tow cannons and learn artillery tactics. Through this, 
                    I was able to drive and gain a deep understanding of the importance of vehicle 
                    operation in complex military operations, additionally acquire skills as an artilleryman, 
                    and learn coping skills in tactical situations. Towed artillery training requires 
                    teamwork and precision, which are directly related to survival on the battlefield.</p>

                <h3>3. Military service period</h3>
                <p>I learned a lot while serving in the military. Military life opened up a new world 
                    to me, and I experienced many challenges and growth in the process. 
                    Living and training with colleagues from different backgrounds taught me how to 
                    cooperate and rely on each other. Additionally, there were many opportunities to 
                    demonstrate leadership while carrying out various military operations. These 
                    experiences developed my patience and perseverance, improved my problem-solving 
                    and coping skills, and became a valuable foundation for my life.</p>
